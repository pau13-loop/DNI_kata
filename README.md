# SOLID DNI

> In this repository you'll wind the **Christmas Kata** called _SOLID DNI Kata_. This project has been designed for the Web Development students of the first year. You need to write a program that get the letter of the NIF from the numbers of the DNI. The algorithm is quite easy but this kata is about the comprehension of the SOLID principles and start to work with the paradigm of the OOP (Object Oriented Programing).

## Motivation

This project motivation is get to be able to understand and work with the SOLID principles and the OOP because both of them are strong related with each other. This kata looks to me like an easy and enjoyable way to start to dive into the OOP programing.

## Content

> The content of this project it's separed into two different directories **Domain** and **Resources**.

### Domain

In this direcotry we will find that it's subdivided into another two, **src** and **test**.

- **src**

Inside _src_ we have the algorithm of the main program.

---

- **test**

Inside _test_ we have all the test cases that have been built to check the functionality of the program and if it runs correctly following the rules of the SOLID DNI Kata.

<!-- ### Resources

The directory of _resources_ how it tells the name has been built to keep all the external resources to the main DNI program of the kata, in it we'll find:

---

###### DNI program explanation

In this document we have the DNI program explained routine by routine with the aim of make easier the comprehesion of the algorithm of the DNI program.

## Reflections

This DNI SOLID Kata has been really helpfull to me to understand how it works the OOP. Before I didn't know too much about it and thanks to solve this kata now i can work with classes on Python. An easy algorithm to improve your coding and comprehension skills.
